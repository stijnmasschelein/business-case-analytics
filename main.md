# Synopsis

The goal of this initiative is to create an informal incubator for data analytics projects. undergraduate students can work on projects to develop data analysis, programming, and project management skills. initially students can work on small research projects or with university data. These projects should prepare them to work as interns with industry partners. The long term reward for us would be that our students can take on programming tasks that we do not have to do and they are involved with the latest data analytics projects in industry. 

# Philosophy

I want to start this initiative from a couple of principles. The main one is that the projects should be easy to check and easy to communicate. This will help us and the students to show of their work and it will build a library of examples for future students. One consequence is that I want to focus on open source tools such as `R` and `Python`. I personally have a fondness for the `R` ecosystem because it makes it easy to analyse data, visualise the results, and to put the output on a website or in an interactive dashboard. 

Another consequence is that I want easily readible documentation for the projects which we can put on a website. This helps with sharing the project with other people who work on the project. There are a number of tools such as `markdown`, `overleaf`, `rmarkdown`, and `jupyter` that provide opportunities to write up the process of the projects. 

Over time, I want the projects to become meta-projects where they involve coming up with tools that helps us manage all the projects. They could be tools for datasharing or remote working together or for tracking performance of projects over time. A student could make an internal dashboard to track the overall progress of the projects.

Lastly, the student owns the intellectual property of their work.
- Maybe contact former student about open data and legal issues. 

# Type of Projects
- See notes on booknote
- Ray suggest to use internal budgeting data and maybe student numbers.     There are going to be issues with this. 
- Help with funding
- Merging data on publications 

# Example

Melinda Hodkiewtiz and Data Safety Lab

# Outcomes for students

## Recognition
- Working on proto types, they keep the intellectual property, opportunity to have a portfolio.

## Outside opportunities at the end 
- Landgate (for PhD students)
- Western Power
- Placements 
- Ceed funding engineering

# Timeline
## First semester 2020
- Attracting students for projects. First attempts for some projects.
- Attracting projects from within the university. Not RA jobs.
- Sorting out legal IP issues.
- Thinking of funding opportunities
- Two weekly Friday (?) progress meetings

## Second semester 2020
- Evaluating the first semester and looking for funding
- Adapt governance structure

## First semester 2021 
- Put structure in place with student leaders. PhD students are more        experienced. We should help with developing some team leader skills but it can also be part of the documentation of the process. 

## Second semester 2021
