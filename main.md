# Synopsis

The goal of this initiative is to create an informal incubator for data analytics projects. Undergraduate students can work on projects to develop data analysis, programming, and project management skills. Initially students can work on small research projects or with university data. These projects should prepare them to work as interns with industry partners and give them practical project tangible outcomes they can use as a portfolio. The long term reward for us would be that our students can take on programming tasks that we do not have to do and they are involved with the latest data analytics projects in industry. 

# Philosophy

I want to start this initiative from a couple of principles. The main one is that the projects should be easy to check and easy to communicate. This will help us and the students to show off their work and it will build a library of examples for future students. One consequence is that I want to focus on open source tools such as `R` and `python`. I personally have a fondness for the `R` ecosystem because it makes it easy to analyse data, visualise the results, and to put the output on a website or in an interactive dashboard. I am sure that `python` and tools like powerBI 

Another consequence is that I want easily readible documentation for the projects which we can put on a website. This helps with sharing the project with other people who work on the project. There are a number of tools such as [`markdown`][markdown], [`overleaf`][overleaf], [`rmarkdown`][rmarkdown], and [`jupyter`][jupyter] that provide opportunities to write up the process of the projects in non-traditional ways that are easy to share and collaborate on.

Over time, I want the projects to become meta-projects where they involve coming up with tools that helps us manage all the projects. They could be tools for datasharing or remote working together or for tracking performance of projects over time. A student could make an internal dashboard to track the overall progress of the projects.

I also want to make it as easy as possible for students to keep the intellectual property rights to their work. I need to figure this out but I know who I can contact to get this organised. 

A lot of the principles are coming from Melinda Hodkiewitz from the [UWA System Health Lab][SHL] who has set up a similar informal system partly funded by a number of big grants. The funding allowed her to actually pay the students as casual staff. To me this would be the ideal outcome in the long run. That is, to attract funding to pay students for their work. 

# Type of Projects

The initial projects that I have in mind are small things that can benefit the Business School or UWA but which is currently not done because of lack of time and immediate needs. On the other hand, I want to avoid that the students are just for our benefit and the students have nothing to show for. So, I would want to avoid pure data cleaning or data collection exercises. Especially, if we are not paying I see no real benefit for the students from working on data collection. That is more a research assistant job.

The following are a number of examples from my experience but by no means exhaustive. 

## Data access and organisation

I have a paper with a bunch of simulation results. The paper necessarily only presents a small subset of all the possible results. An entreprising student could merge all the simulation data and make a website where subsets of the data can easily selected and downloaded. 
I personally think that this would be a good exercise for research groups or labs that collect a lot of similar datasets for instance repeated surveys with overlapping questions or lab experiment with the same task but different manipulations. 

## Research output and communication

An additional advantage of merging data and make it easily accessible is that we can visualise the data to communicate our research in a visual interesting way or through an interactive website. I would love to do this for my simulation study! There are already way too many results in that paper but we also left out a lot.

In addition, a student could also make a package or a code page with all the analyses and data cleaning for the results in a paper. The top economics journals already require this but in reality most of these code pages are actually hard to follow or replicate. 

## Administrative data

The university has a lot of administrative data, for instance from publications. A student could combine the publication information with the old and the updated ABDC list and build a dashboard to track the business schools publication track record.

Raymond Da Silva Rosa also suggested that something like this could be interesting with some of the internal budgeting data as well. Now, I can see a host of potential complaints with this as well but I am open to building visualisation tools of internal data.

There might also be ways to automate some administrative tasks such as keeping track and inputting marks for a unit and upload it to blackboard.

# Outcomes for students

## Recognition
- Working on proto types, they keep the intellectual property, opportunity to have a portfolio.

## Outside opportunities at the end 
- Landgate (for PhD students)
- Western Power
- Placements 
- Ceed funding engineering
- Peter Robinson and placements

# Timeline
## First semester 2020
- Attracting students for projects. First attempts for some projects.
- Attracting projects from within the university. Not RA jobs.
- Sorting out legal IP issues.
- Thinking of funding opportunities
- Two weekly Friday (?) progress meetings

## Second semester 2020
- Evaluating the first semester and looking for funding
- Adapt governance structure

## First semester 2021 
- Put structure in place with student leaders. PhD students are more        experienced. We should help with developing some team leader skills but it can also be part of the documentation of the process.
